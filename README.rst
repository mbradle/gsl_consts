Overview
========

It may be convenient for python users to have available physical
constants from the
`Gnu Scientific Library <https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>`_
without installing GSL itself.  This package makes those constants
available directly.

Installation
------------

Install from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/gsl_consts>`_ with pip by
typing in your favorite terminal::

    $ pip install gsl_consts
